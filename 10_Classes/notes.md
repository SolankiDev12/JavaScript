## 4 pillars
#### Abstraction
Abstraction hides complexity by showing only relevant information.

#### Encapsulation
Encapsulation hides the internal state and requires all interaction to be performed through methods.
#### Inheritance
Inheritance means creating a new class from an existing class. The new class (child) gets the features of the existing class (parent), and can also have its own features. For example, a “Dog” class can inherit from an “Animal” class

#### Polymorphism

Polymorphism means “many forms.” It lets you use a single action in different ways. For example, you can have a method called draw() that works differently for a circle, a square, or a triangle, but you call it the same way.
